Fortune Telling with Sticks!

•	Item List:
o	Tilt Sensor
	220 resisters
o	LCD Monitor 
	10k ?? Resister

	
	
Premise:
	Based off Chinese stick fortune telling, the user will tilt the sensor and then receive a random fortune that will read out on the LCD monitor.

Coding thoughts:
1.	Make an array that contains X amount of fortunes.
2.	Make the tilt sensor an INPUT that that causes an element of the array to be randomly chosen.
3.	Once the element is chosen, it will be displayed on the LED
Actual Process:
1.	Going through the book, it’ll be easy to split this into two parts
a.	Tilt Sensor
# The simplest part of this project, I can take the coding used in Project 8: Digital Hourglass.
##Declare a switchPin, a constant variable, the pin it’ll start on is 8.
#	Create two variables
##	Int switchState = 0; will cover the switchstate received
##	Int prevSwitchState = 0; will allow the former variable to be compared, which should tell the rest of the Arduino to trigger a fortune.
#	Void setup(){
##	pinMode(switchPin,INPUT);} should declare that the variable switchPin will be an input.
#	Void loop(){
##	switchState = digitalRead(switchPin);} reads if the switch has been tilted.
#	LCD
