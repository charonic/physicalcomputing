   # Mark 7 Sound Amplifier - The Banshee
     ## The M7SA is the latest in "End the lives of your enemies, small animals and raiders" to hit the wastelands!
    This handy rifle will plug into a handy, solar-powered charger will be fully charged within the hour (depending on the amount of sunlight of course).
    Operating the Banshee is simple!

# Step 1:
Brace the Banshee to your shoulder, flip open the Banshee's mouth piece and manuever your mouth to the Banshee's mouth bit. 

# Step 2:
Aim the Banshee at whaatever you want to brown note!

# Step 3:
The M7SA has a simple slider on the left side of the stock, this handy little slider functions as volume control. The closer you move the slide to you, the more volume you'll project in a bullet shaped cone at your target!

But wait, there's more! Not only will the Banshee allow you to fire a bullet of sound into whatever you target, the Banshee also has these other functions:


* The slider's polar opposite end allows you to whisper a message at a target up to 100 feet away!
* The slider's middle function allows you to fire a sonic bullet at a lower level, still lethal and much quieter than the noisy guns of the pre-Apocalypse.

# Step 4:
Aim at whatever you want to scream to death (or message) and squeeze the trigger. While the trigger is held, yell, scream, recite poetry, insult their honor, insult their mother or snap off a one liner into the voice amplifier.
